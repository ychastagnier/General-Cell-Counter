# General-Cell-Counter

General Cell Counter is a plugin for Fiji to pretreat and threshold images then count cells.

It offers a wide variety of methods to segment cells from background and allows a live preview of the result to help choose the parameters. In addition to the segmentation, it is possible to choose the range of size and circularity of the cells and to set a minimal distance below which two objects are counted as one. Finally, it pools the results from the images in a folder into a single file.
